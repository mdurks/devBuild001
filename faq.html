                <div class="content">
                    <p>UK employers have to automatically enrol their staff into a workplace pension if they meet certain criteria. The law on workplace pensions has now changed and every employer must comply.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>From April 2015 you will no longer have to buy an annuity with your pension funds. In fact, all restrictions on your pension pot will be removed and you will have total freedom over how you withdraw your money.</p>
                    <p> Under the new rules you will be able to access your entire pension after the age of 55. As is the case now, 25% of your money can be withdrawn free of any income tax.  The remaining 75% of your money will be subject to income tax at your highest marginal rate. You can withdraw it all at once or in stages.</p>
                    <p>Once you have withdrawn your money, you can spend or invest it in any way you see fit.</p>

                    Upon retirement, you will have the option of a tax-free cash sum of up to 25% of your fund’s investment value, together with the ability to purchase a pension payment for yourself, your spouse or your dependents. All pensions will be secured by way of an annuity and you may select the provider you prefer.
